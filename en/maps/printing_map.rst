Printing maps
=============

If you plan to make an outdoor trip, it could be advisable to print a map of the route. So that you can find your way, even in the case your device breaks down.

To print a map, first :ref:`select the part of the map <ss-map-select>` that needs to be printed. You can do this by pressing long with two fingers simultaneously on the map.
Moving the fingers can change the selection. If you release your fingers, tap 'Print' in the pop-up. You could also rotate the map first, before making a selection.
