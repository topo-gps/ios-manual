Dashboard
=========

In the section 'Dashboard' of the :ref:`Settings <ss-settings>` you can choose the button that appears on the right hand side of the :ref:`Dashboard <sec-dashboard>`. Normally this set to the 'Route button'. You can choose between 'Routes', 'Waypoints', 'Layers', 'Maps', 'Camera' and 'Search'.
Depending on how you are using Topo GPS you might want to choose a different button. For example if you take a lot of photo's with Topo GPS you could set this button to 'Camera', so that it will become easier to take photo's.
