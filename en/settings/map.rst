Map
===

In the section 'Map' you find the switch 'Additional zoom in'.
If you enable this switch you can zoom in the map up to 8 times as far as without enabling it.
The drawback is that the maps will become grainy when zoomed in that far.

Waypoints that lie very close to each other can be separated more easily be enabling this setting.
