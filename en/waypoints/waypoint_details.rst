On the top right of the waypoint details screen you find a map icon with a slash. If you tap this button, the waypoint will be removed from
the main map. If the waypoint is not loaded on the map, a map icon withouth a slash is shown. If you tap that icon, the waypoint will be loaded on the map and you will return to the main map.

The waypoint details screen contains information about the waypoint, such as the title and the coordinates. If available you can also find here a description, photos, a phone number and/or an URL.

The coordinates are displayed in various formats. You can set the displayed coordinate types by tapping the '>' next to the coordinates. If you press long on the coordinates you can select them and copy the coordinates in text format.

The physical address of a waypoint is also displayed in the details screen. If the address of a waypoint is still unknown, Topo GPS will look up this address in a database of Apple. For this you have to enable the option :ref:`Addresses - find automatically <sec-settings-addresses>` in the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>`. You have also to be connected to the internet.

Note that this map will not show up if you have disabled location access for Topo GPS. On the left hand side of the map there is a 'Plan route' button. If you tap this button a route will be planned from your current location to the waypoint with the transportation mode which is displayed below the plan button. If you tap the transportation mode button below the plan button you can change the transportation mode.

If you scroll down to the bottom of the waypoint details screen, you can find the creation and modification date and time. Note that if you move the waypoint to another folder, the modification date and time is also updated.

- ‘<‘ and ‘>’ button: Allows you to browse through the list of waypoints, or through the waypoints that are loaded on the map.
- Trash button: If you press this button a pop-up will show up asking you whether you would like to :ref:`remove the waypoint from your device <ss-waypoint-remove>`.
