Waypoints
=========

A waypoint is a location that can be added to the map. The icon and the title of the waypoint are shown on the map. Possible additional information such as photos and a description can be :ref:`displayed <ss-waypoint-details>` by tapping the waypoint. Waypoints can be :ref:`loaded <ss-waypoint-load>` on the map and can be :ref:`imported <ss-waypoints-importing>` in and :ref:`exported <ss-waypoints-exporting>` to various formats.

In the waypoints screen (:ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Waypoints) you can do all sorts of things with waypoints.
