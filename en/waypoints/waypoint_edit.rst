Editing waypoints
=================
To edit a waypoint you have to press the ‘Edit’ button on the bottom of the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`.
If you press this button an edit pop-up will appear like in the figure below:

   *A pop-up with five possibilities to modify a waypoint.*

The pop-up shows five possibilities to modify the waypoint.

- *Change icon*: Allows you to :ref:`change the icon of the waypoint <ss-waypoint-change-icon>`.
- *Move on map*: Allows you to :ref:`move the waypoint on the map <ss-waypoint-edit-map>`.
- *Edit coordinates*: Allows you to :ref:`edit the coordinates <ss-waypoint-edit-coordinates>` of a waypoint.
- *Edit photos*: Allows you to :ref:`edit the photos <ss-waypoint-edit-photos>` of a waypoint.
- *Edit text*: Allows you to :ref:`edit the title and description <ss-waypoint-edit-title>` of a waypoint.

.. _ss-waypoint-edit-title:

Editing title and description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By pressing ‘Edit text’ in the :ref:`edit pop-up <ss-waypoint-edit>` you can modify the title and
the description of the waypoint. An example is shown below:

.. figure:: ../_static/waypoint-edit-text1.png

   :alt: Editing Waypoints Topo GPS

   *Modifying the description of the waypoint ‘Stonehenge’.*

To save the changes you have to press ‘Save’ on the top right of the screen. You return to the waypoints details screen as you can see below:

.. figure:: ../_static/waypoint-edit-text2.png
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Editing Waypoints Topo GPS

   *The description of the waypoint ‘Stonehenge’ has been modified.*


.. _ss-waypoint-edit-photos:

Editing photos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By pressing the 'Edit photos' button in the :ref:`edit pop-up <ss-waypoint-edit>` you can add photos to the waypoint
and remove photos from the waypoint. If you press this button the following screen will appear.

.. figure:: ../_static/waypoint-photo1.png
   :height: 568px

   :alt: Empty photos screen Topo GPS

   *The photos screen if the waypoint does not have photos.*

In the bottom toolbar of the photos screen you can find three buttons:

- *Folder button*: If you press this button you can import photos from your photo library to the waypoint.
- *Camera button*: If you press this button the camera will be opened. If you take a photo it will be added to the waypoint. You could also use Menu > Camera for this, then a waypoint is automatically created at your current location and the taken photo is added to it.
- *Trash button*: If you press this button you can remove the currently displayed photo from a waypoint.

If you have made changes to the photos of a waypoint you have to press 'Done' on the top right to save the changes. If you press 'Cancel' the photos will not be modified.

As an example we now will add a photo of ’Stonehenge’ from our photo library by pressing the map icon. An example of the screen that appears is displayed below:

.. figure:: ../_static/waypoint-photo2.jpg

   *The photo library*

(Used photo of Stonehenge CC-BY 2.0: `garethwiscombe <https://www.flickr.com/photos/garethwiscombe/1071477228/in/photostream/>`_)

In the photo library you can choose a photo. By pressing the photo it will be imported and added to the photos screen as you can see below.

.. figure:: ../_static/waypoint-photo3.jpg
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Photos screen with photo Topo GPS

   *A photo of Stonehenge is added to the photos screen.*

If you like you can add more photos from the library or using the camera. The added photos are always copied to Topo GPS. So removing the photo afterwards from your photo library does not remove the photo in Topo GPS. The resolution of the added photo can be set via 'Menu > Settings > Camera > Photo size'. Larger photo sizes will require more disk space.

If you want to confirm the changes to the photos you have to press ‘Done’ on the top right of the photos screen. The changes will then be saved and the photo will be added to the waypoint.  

You can view the added photos in the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>` as is illustrated in the figure below:

.. figure:: ../_static/waypoint-photo4.jpg
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Editing Waypoints Topo GPS

   *A photo of Stonehenge can be viewed in the waypoint details screen.*

If you tap a photo in the waypoint details screen, the photo screen will be opened with a larger version of the tapped photo.

   *The photo screen with a photo of Stonehenge.*

You can zoom in on the displayed photo by making a zoom gesture with two fingers. Sharing the photo is possible by pressing the 'Export' icon on the top right. If you press 'Edit' on the top right you can modify the photos of the waypoint. If the waypoint has multiple photo's, you can browse through the available photos by sliding the current photo to the left or to the right.

Editing coordinates

By pressing ‘Edit coordinates’ in the :ref:`edit pop-up <ss-waypoint-edit>`

If you tap an icon, the waypoint icon will be changed and you will return to the waypoint details screen. You can create a new icon by pressing + in the waypoint icons screen.
