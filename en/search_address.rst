Searching addresses and places

Then tap the the item ‘Search place or address’.

A screen will appear in which you can enter addresses and place names. 

Loading single search result

As an example we now will enter the town ‘Alton’ in the search box. While typing search results will appear in the
list below the search box, as you can see below:

   *Searching the town ‘Alton’*

In order to be able to find addresses or places you have to be connected to the internet. Searching will occur via a service
of Apple.

If you tap on a search result in the list, it will be loaded on the map as a waypoint and you will return to the main screen. 
An example is shown below:

   *The search result ‘Alton’ has been loaded on the map.*

In the settings (Menu > More > Settings) you can control whether used search results are automatically saved as a waypoint. The default setting is not to save automatically in order not to clutter your list of waypoint with search results. If you want to save search result as a waypoint, you could tap it to open the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`. There you can tap 'Save' in the bottom right to save the search result.

Loading all search results

You can also search on a keyword, like for example ‘Pub’.  The results that appear in the list depend on 
the area that is currently visible in the map screen. If you search for Pub and the map is zoomed to Alton, only
pubs near Alton will show up, like in the figure below:

Your searches will be saved in the search history. This can be disabled in the :ref:`settings <sec-settings-search-results>`.
