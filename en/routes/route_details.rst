Route details
=============
By tapping the information button (i) on the right hand side of a route title in :ref:`saved routes screen <sec-routes-load>` (Menu > Routes > Saved routes) the route details screen appears. 

If you have :ref:`loaded a route on the map <sec-routes-load>`, you can also open the route details screen by tapping the route curve in the main screen.

An example of the route details screen is shown below.

   *An example of the route details screen.*

If you tap the map icon with the slash on the top right, the route will be removed from the map. If the route is not loaded on the map, a map icon will be shown instead. If you tap the map icon, the route will be loaded on the map and you will return to the map.

In the top of the route details screen a map with the route is displayed.

Next you can see the title, the route type, distance, time (if the route is recorded), total ascent (if available) and author. If you tap this item, you can view additional details of a route.

A description and photos will be shown if they are present. If you tap a photo, it will be shown full screen and you can browse through the photos as in a slideshow.

Next, if present an altitude/elevation profile, a speed and a distance profile are shown. You can tap these profiles to view the :ref:`profile in more detail <sec-route-profiles>` and see additional height and speed information.

If you scroll further down to the section 'Tiles on current map', you can :ref:`download the map tiles of a route <sec-route-map-tiles>`.

In the bottom of the routes details screen you can find a toolbar with the following buttons:

- *‘<‘ and ‘>’ buttons*: With these buttons you can browse backward and forward through the route details of a collection of routes.
- *Trash button*: If you tap this button you can :ref:`remove the currently shown route from your device <sec-route-remove>`.
- *Export button*: If you tap this button you can :ref:`export the route <sec-routes-export>`.
- *Edit button*: If you tap this button an pop-up will be shown which you can use to :ref:`edit the route <ss-route-edit>`.
