Extending a route
=================
To extend a route, first :ref:`load the route in the route planner <ss-route-track-edit>` as explained above. 


Then tap the last route point so that it becomes selected and green. 
You can now can add a route point by pressing long on the map. A blue route point will appear.
As long as you hold your finger on the map, you can drag the blue 
route point to the desired location. If you release your finger a route
will be drawn from the green route point to the added route point. The added
route point will be selected and colored green. An example of extending the route in the figure above
is shown below.

   *The route is extended to the added route point.*

You can now save the extended route by pressing ‘Save’ in the route planner 
window. A saved route will be always stored as a new route.
