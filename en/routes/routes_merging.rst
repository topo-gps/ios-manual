Merging routes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To merge routes, first open the :ref:`route planner <sec-route-plan>`. Add one route to the planner by tapping 'More > Add route'. Tap the desired route and choose 'Join to planner'. Repeat the previous step to add more routes to the planner.

If you press ‘Save’ in the route planner window, the saved route will be the combination of all added routes.
