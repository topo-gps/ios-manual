Editing routes

To edit a route, first open the :ref:`route details screen <sec-route-details>`. Then tap the button 'Edit' in the bottom toolbar. A pop-up appears as you can see in the example below:

   *Edit options pop-up route details screen.*

In the edit pop-up you can choose between the following options:

- *Edit line style*. If you tap this option, a screen will appear in which you can set a custom line width and color for the route.
- *Edit text*. If you tap this option, a screen will appear in which you can edit the title, author details and description.
- *Edit route type*. If you tap this option, a screen will appear in which you can change the route type.
- *Edit track*. If you tap this option, the route will be loaded into the planner where you can modify the route track. Then you could :ref:`extend the route <sec-route-extend>`, :ref:`shorten the route <sec-route-shorten>` or :ref:`modify the route track in a different way <sec-route-edit-track>`.
- *Edit waypoints*. If you tap this option, the waypoints belonging to the route will be shown in a waypoints screen. You can modify and remove waypoints just like you do with normal waypoints.
- *Edit settings*. If you tap this option, you can alter the settings of a route. You can determine whether to enable showing the waypoints of a route. Furthermore you can enable 'Reverse direction', which reverses the direction of a route.
