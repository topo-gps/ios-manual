Routes
======

A route is a collection of points that can be :ref:`shown as a curve on the map <sec-routes-load>`. A route can have possible additional information (like photo's and a description) that can be shown in the :ref:`route details screen <sec-route-details>`.

In Topo GPS you can :ref:`import <sec-routes-import>`, :ref:`plan <sec-route-plan>`, :ref:`generate <sec-route-generate>`, :ref:`record <sec-route-record>`, and :ref:`export <sec-routes-export>` routes. This can all be done via the :ref:`routes pop-up <sec-routes-popup>`. You can open the routes pop-up by either tapping the :ref:`route button <ss-route-button>` on the dashboard or by tapping :ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Routes.
