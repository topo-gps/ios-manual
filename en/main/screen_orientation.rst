Screen orientation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By rotating your device you can change the screen orientation from portrait to landscape. An example of landscape mode is displayed below:

.. figure:: ../_static/map4.png  
   :height: 320px
   :width: 568px
   :alt: Screen orientation landscape Topo GPS

   *Main screen in landscape mode.*
   
If the screen does not rotate if you rotate your device, you should check the 'Control Center'. Swipe down from the top-right corner of your screen to open Control Center. Tap the Orientation Lock button if it is enabled. Next to that you should disable the Topo GPS setting :ref:`Display Orientation > Lock <sec-settings-display-orientation>`.

If you do not want the screen to rotate if you rotate your device, you should enable the Topo GPS :ref:`Display Orientation > Lock <sec-settings-display-orientation>`.
