Main screen
===========
If you open the Topo GPS app a screen with a map will be displayed. This is the main screen. An example is shown below:

   :width: 320px
   :alt: Topo GPS main screen

   *The main screen of Topo GPS. The red marker indicates your current location.*

On the bottom of the main screen you can find a bar with meters which is the :ref:`dashboard <sec-dashboard>`.
If you pull the dashboard upwards the :ref:`menu <sec-menu>` will appear. 

The red marker with the arrow in indicates :ref:`your current location on the map <sec-posmarker>`. 

The label on the upper left side of the map indicates the percentage offline accessible map tiles of the area that is currently displayed. By tapping this label you can :ref:`download maps for offline use <sec-cache>`. 

On the bottom right corner of the map you can find a scale indicator. Using the scale indicator you can quickly estimate the distance between two points on the map. You can also use the :ref:`map ruler <ss-map-ruler>` to measure distances and angles more precisely.

On the bottom left corner of the map you will find the copyright information of the current map. If you tap this label either a pop-up will appear or directly the map copyright information screen. In the pop-up you can choose between :ref:`copyright information <ss-map-copyright>` or :ref:`legend <ss-legend>`. For some maps also a map error tab appears, which you can use to report feedback on the map.
